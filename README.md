# Mini Sonic The Hedgehog Prototype Hack
A hack based on the MDDC disassembly of the Sonic 1 Prototype
## Changes/Credits
* AMPS (by AuroraFields), and Error Handler (by vladikcomper)
* Different layouts/palette's (only for GHZ atm - by RepellantMold)
* Partially fixed the spike bug (you go through the spikes if you still are invulnerable, still trying to figure out - by RepellantMold)
* Improved Enigma/Kosinski decompressors (by vladikcomper/flamewing/MarkeyJester)
* Fullscreen PAL experience (not completely functional)
